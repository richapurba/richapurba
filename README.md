### Hello, there. 👋 Nice to have you here.<br/>
I am a sister, university student ambassador, and now actively looking for new opportunity as a front end developer. I graduated from high school in 2017; and I've spent the last year as a business consultant. Being a coder doesn't mean I have the same lifestyle with others. I have a lot of patience, that's why I'm using windows😂 Also, I'm an extrovert, I really love networking and team building. To know more about me, just simply have a talk with me or you can go trought my website down here.<br/><br/>

📚 I'm currently working towards my BS in Computer Science degree from University of the People<br/>
💎 I always want to learn something new. 🔬 In fact, I'm a crazy person who always curious about almost everything<br/>
🏆 I really love reading books. I have tons of them in my room and read them daily 📖<br/>
🔫 I'm using VS Code as my gun, StackOverFlow and my coding skills as the bullets, and my brain as the hand that will lead the gun to fire<br/>
