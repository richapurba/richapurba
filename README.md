### Hi, there. 👋 Nice to have you here.
I am a sister, university student, and now actively looking for new opportunity as a Software Front End Engineer. I graduated from high school in 2017, and I've spent the last year as a Business Consultant.</br></br>

📚 I'm currently working towards my BSc. in Computer Science degree from University of the People.</br>
💎 The most precious thing in this world for me is my family. I have two brothers and a sister.</br>
🏆 The greatest achievement of me is getting love from my late mother. The worst is I ever made her cry for my faults.</br>
🔫 I'm using VS Code as my gun, StackOverFlow and my coding skills as the bullets, and my brain as the hand that will lead the gun to fire.</br></br>

😲 FUN FACTS ABOUT ME 😲</br>
☑️ My most favourite food is "Nasi Goreng"🍽</br>
☑️ I'm afraid of cockroaches and dogs 🐕 The most frightening thing is the flying cockroach😭</br>
☑️ I always want to learn something new 🔬</br>
☑️ I really love reading books. I read them daily 📖</br>
☑️ I can't swim at the water 🏊 , but if you ask me to swim on the ground, well, absolutely I can 😂</br>
